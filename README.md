# Ruby Console & Object Oriented Ruby

## The Plan

This pairing lab does not have a designated place to switch drivers. Instead, every 30 minutes the pair's responsibilities should swap. The driver becomes the navigator, and vice versa.

To minimize extra cloning and forking, this project should be completed in only one person's Github account, on one computer.

## What is a `console`

A programming console is a coding environment to run text based code. `console`s give developers a way to interact with the domain they are working on. Similar to adding a breakpoint in your code (`binding.pry`), `console`s have access to all the Ruby classes and objects you have created in your program.

We've provided you with a console that you can use in this lab. To enter the console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb`. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here.

## Domain mapping

Before you start building the domain outlined below, read over the application interface and discuss what the relationship of these objects are. What belongs to what? What has many of another? What links other objects together? What object serves as a source of truth for connecting a relationship between two other objects?
